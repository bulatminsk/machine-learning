This course is a series of explanations (with code) about the main concepts of machine learning. I wrote this guide to myself in order to validate my own knowledge, and also for helping other people that want to dive into the topic.

## Prerequisites

#### Previous knowledge 🤔

To understand this course, you must have some experience with programming (all the code will be in Python). And also be good math and statistics (I dont have a strong mathematical backgroud, so don't worry).

#### System requirements 🖥

You must have installed python 3 in you computer.
