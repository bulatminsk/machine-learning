## Supervised learning

It is **function approximation**. So it's about figuring out the common rule (a function) that applies to our **labeled data**, in order to predict new unlabeled data in the future.

> #### Steps:
> 1. Collect labeled data
> 2. Inferring a function.
> 3. Predict new data!

## Unsupervised learning

Is about looking at raw data and inferring its structure just by lookng at the inputs and the realtion between them.
